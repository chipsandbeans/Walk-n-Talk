    <p class="health">Research from U.C.L.A. suggests that putting your feelings into words — a process called “affect labeling” — can diminish the response of the amygdala when you encounter things that are upsetting. 

        This is how, over time, you can become less stressed over something that bothers you. For example, if you got in a car accident, even being in a car immediately afterward could overwhelm you emotionally. 
        
        But as you talk through your experience, put your feelings into words and process what happened, you can get back in the car without having the same emotional reaction. </p>
