        Walk 'n' Talk is a collective of walking groups based in Cork, Ireland. Our aim is to get as many people out and about in the evenings walking and talking with eachother. We see the amazing physical and mental health benefits of walking, talking and making new friends and wish to share this with as many people as possible in an effort to improve the mental and physical health of our local communities. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We here at Walk 'n' Talk make every effort to be as inclusive as possible for those of us who are wheelchair bound or have other mobility issues. We make sure that our walking routes follow well-paved paths which have adequate spacing for wheelchair users. All of our walking routes are on flat surfaces, we aim to avoid hills as they make the route unnecessarily difficult for wheelchair users and those of us who use walking aids such as zimmer frames and walking sticks.
        <br>
        <br>
        All of our walks are pet-friendly so feel free to bring your fluffy friends with you! Our only wish is that all pets are kept on lead unless they are well trained and have demonstrated that they have good recall.
